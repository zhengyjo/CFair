# CFair

This repository contains code and supplementary materials for our submission CFair to the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference 2023.

## Abstract
CFair is a propensity-score-based method for identifying counterparts, which prevents fairness evaluation from comparing "oranges" with "apples". 
In addition, we propose a counterpart-based statistical fairness index, termed Counterpart-Fairness (CFair), to assess fairness of ML models.

## Dataset
We are using Sepsis patients from MIMIC-IV dataset.
0. User may need to apply for the access to MIMIC dataset by going to [this page](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/)
1. Please use the files in sql folder to extract the raw data of sepsis patients from MIMIC-IV 
2. Please use the file from pre-processing folder to process the data
